welcome_message=Congratulations, you have been hired by Asteroid Agency!\n\nIn the time between your company space-policy compliance trainings and cracking open cold ones in the space-barracks with the space-boys, you will perform the job you were hired to do: mine valuable gems out of the surrounding asteroids.\n\nWatch out though - lately, there has been an abnormal amount of bright green space junk floating around. Try your best not to run into any. Oh and do watch out for our rival companies. You know what they say, a man will do anything for a piece of asteroid ore.\n\nAs for training, all you need to know is this: Asteroid Agency has developed a sophisticated piece of technology that allows you to collect gems from asteroids by smashing into them! Sounds easy, right? It seems that all of our experienced pilots have died, so we have adapted to put anyone who can smash things into a spaceship.\n\nNow get out there, and make the company rich!
